## 🚀 Core Ecosystem

### 🧪 Advanced Intelligence Notebook
The heart of the HaoXai console. It provides a premium, IDE-like experience for data scientists and researchers.
- **Universal Runtime**: Execute **SQL**, **Python**, and **R** in a single workflow.
- **Smart Fix AI**: Real-time error detection that suggests actionable solutions (e.g., variable definitions, syntax corrections) directly in the insight panel.
- **Universal Search**: Fast, "Google-like" search across your files, database schemas, and notebook history.

### 💬 AI Data Assistant
A conversational interface that bridges the gap between raw data and scientific insight.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask complex questions about your database in plain English.
- **Context-Aware**: Integrates with the ML ecosystem to provide predictive insights and data summaries.

### 📂 Database & Data Management Hub
Enterprise-grade tools for handling colossal datasets with precision.
- **Auto-Linking Engine**: Advanced logic for mapping relational data across fragmented sources (matches by ID, Date, and secondary metadata).
- **Excel Power-Tools**: Bulk import, merging, and validation for high-volume scientific spreadsheets.
- **Secure Infrastructure**: Support for SQLite (portable) and MariaDB/MySQL (enterprise) with connection pooling and automated backups.

### 🧬 Specialized Scientific Suite
Dedicated modules for high-precision scientific workflows.
- **Bat Identification**: specialized ML models for predictive species identification based on environmental and morphological data.
- **Extraction Builder Pro**: Streamlined interface for managing sample extractions and laboratory workflows.
- **Sequence Analysis**: Tools for tracking viral loads, sequence metadata, and experimental timelines.

### 📊 Machine Learning Ecosystem
A comprehensive dashboard for monitoring and training your intelligence models.
- **ML Operations**: Monitor model accuracy, loss metrics, and training status in real-time.
- **Internal Trainers**: Custom scripts for training specialized models on project-specific data clusters.
